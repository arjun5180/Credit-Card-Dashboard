## Credit Card Dashboard | SQL + Power BI

I built a comprehensive credit card analysis dashboard using SQL, Power BI, DAX, and Power Query to explore customer behavior, spending patterns, and transaction performance.
## 🔧 Tools Used
🔹 SQL: Created normalized tables (cc_details, cust_details), handled date conversion using STR_TO_DATE(), and used a staging table (cc_details_temp) for clean data migration.

🔹 Power BI: Designed two interactive dashboards:
1️⃣ Customer Insights: Revenue by Age, Gender, Income Group, Marital Status, Job Role
2️⃣ Transaction Insights: Revenue by Card Type, Quarter, Use_Chip Method, Expense Type

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Blue card holders** generated over 80% of total revenue
- **Swipe transactions** led all modes, contributing ~35M in revenue
- **Graduates** and **business professionals** are top spending segments
- **Q3** showed peak weekly revenue across the year
- Most activity concentrated in age groups **30–60** and income group **Low**

## 🛠️ Skills Applied:

SQL (DDL/DML, date functions, data migration)

Power Query (ETL, merge, clean data)

DAX (KPIs, calculated columns, measures)

Data storytelling through interactive visuals
